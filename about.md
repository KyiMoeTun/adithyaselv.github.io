– Mark Twain



Hi, I am *Adithya Selvaprithiviraj*, currently pursuing my final year of undergraduate course majoring in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**. I love thinking about *life*, *Universe* and also love working with electronics. My primary research interest is `Computer Vision`, and related areas of interest include `Robotics` and `Embedded systems`.

 I strongly believe in the *philosophy of learning by doing* and have worked on several [projects](/projects) in fields of Computer Vision, Embedded systems, Robotics and Internet Of Things. I am also one of the core members of [Electrical Research Fraternity](http://www.erfssn.org/).

 Checkout this [link](http://www.erfssn.org/our-achievements/) to have a look at our achievements. I am a foodie and I love trying different food. In my free time, I write small hacks and scripts using python which helps me to automate humdrum tasks.
