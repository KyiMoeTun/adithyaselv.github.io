##**DSO-ART (aka) Digital Painter**
<h6> <em>Mentor - Prof. M.Senthil Kumaran (EEE/SSNCE) <br /> 
 Adithya S, Mervin JB, Sibi Sankar, Sanjay Shreedharan</em> </h6>


![placeholder](/assets/images/dsoart.gif)



* Implemented mathematical functions on Spartan 3E FPGA and used PWM technique to display basic shapes
in a DSO.
* Developed a technique to display any given image in a DSO with the help of image processing and python.

* Implemented Localization and Pose estimation based on arbitrary defined color contours detection using
OpenCV C++ library.
* Implemented A* based search on the image to find the optimal path through a obstacle maze.
* Implemented a PID based control system based on the kinematics of the differential driving system.

##### *To know more about the implementation and algorithm which was developed, checkout [this blog post](http://sibisankar.me/articles/LOCK-part1/) by [sibi sankar](http://sibisankar.me/)* .

##**AeroThrust Pendullum using Arduino**



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lsm37dsPO0k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br />

* Designed a Prototype of Aero- Thrust Pendulum.
* Implemented PI and PID Control Algorithms to achieve stable control of the system using Arduino Uno Microcontroller.
* Implmentation is available on [Github](https://github.com/adithyaselv/Aerothrust-Pendulum)

##**Kiduino**


![placeholder](/assets/images/kiduino.png)



* Developed a library for Arduino that would help the kids learn Arduino with an simple Object Oriented
approach.
* Developed classes for several Sensor modules like HC- SR04,GP2Y0A02YK0F etc and Protocols like SIRC.
* Implmentation is available on [Github](https://github.com/adithyaselv/Kiduino)
