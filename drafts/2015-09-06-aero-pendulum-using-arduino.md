In this tutorial we'll see how to build an Aeropendulum using Arduino. This project was inspired from the [work](http://aeropendulum.arizona.edu/) done by [Eniko T. Enikov](http://ame.engr.arizona.edu/eniko-t-enikov) of Arizona State Univarsity.

#####Motivaton:
The most common problem faced by the students while taking the Control Systems Engineering course is that they find it quite difficult to visualize and understand various control techniques and the corresponding responses of the system. Since I strongly believe the fact of learning by doing, I started searching for a project that would help me to understand Control theory in a better way. Finally I came across [this project](http://aeropendulum.arizona.edu/) and I wanted to replicate the same using arduino.

#####Prerequisites
Inorder to do this project, you need have have some basic understanding of Control theory. You can checkout [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBc_BHxw78s) to get a basic idea of the subject.


####What will you need:

* A High RPM DC motor
* A Propeller
* A L298 H-Bridge Motor Driver Module
* An Arduino UNO
* A Power Supply (RPS 20Volts)
* A ADXL 345 Accelerometer or Wire Wound Servo Potentiometer
* Supporting Rod (Aluminium or carbon fibre)

####Setting up the hardware:
